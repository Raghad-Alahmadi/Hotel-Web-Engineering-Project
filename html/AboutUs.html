                <h1>MAGNOLIA</h1>
                <p>The story begins in the fifties of the twentieth century in Saudi Arabia, where a Saudi man hosted passers-by and travelers.
                His five children are accustomed to seeing their father host people and assist them. He used to provide them with food, drinks, and comfortable bedding.
                The five children grew up, and their love of hospitality and helping grew as well, and In order to prevent the loss of their father's customs, they opened the <b>Magnolia Hotel</b>.
                This large hotel chain was established in the early 1980s with the goal of redefining the concept of luxury and comfort in the hotel industry. As a leading provider of hosting services, we ensure that our visitors have a memorable experience.</p>
